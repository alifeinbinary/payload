# Payload Commerce

Welcome to the official Payload ecommerce template! **Still work in progress** so this readme is going to be light in details. Full release ETA early Q1 in 2025. This current iteration is lacking polish, final design, assets and a few planned features. The core workflow works with variants, Stripe checkout and more though.

To get setup it's gonna require you to copy the `.env.example` file into `.env` and add the missing variables. The most important ones are the Stripe ones.

Full tutorial and documentation will follow.

## Features

- Products with variants, custom pricing
- User accounts with cart sync
- Guest checkout
- Viewing order history (as guest too)
- Building pages with blocks
- Static generation of pages with on demand revalidation
