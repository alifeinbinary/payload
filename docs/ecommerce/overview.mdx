## Installation

Install the plugin using any JavaScript package manager like [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), [npm](https://npmjs.com), or [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com):

```bash
  pnpm add @payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce
```

## Basic Usage

In the `plugins` array of your [Payload Config](https://payloadcms.com/docs/configuration/overview), call the plugin with:

```ts
import { buildConfig } from 'payload'
import { ecommercePlugin } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce'

const config = buildConfig({
  collections: [
    {
      slug: 'pages',
      fields: [],
    },
  ],
  plugins: [
    ecommercePlugin({
      // You must add your access control functions here
      access: {
        adminOnly,
        adminOnlyFieldAccess,
        adminOrCustomerOwner,
        adminOrPublishedStatus,
        customerOnlyFieldAccess,
      },
      customers: { slug: 'users' },
    }),
  ],
})

export default config
```

## TypeScript

The plugin will inherit the types from your generated Payload types where possible. We also export the following types:

- `Cart` - The cart type as stored in the React state and local storage and on the client side.
- `CollectionOverride` - Type for overriding collections.
- `CurrenciesConfig` - Type for the currencies configuration.
- `EcommercePluginConfig` - The configuration object for the ecommerce plugin.
- `FieldsOverride` - Type for overriding fields in collections.

All types can be directly imported:

```ts
import { EcommercePluginConfig } from '@payloadcms/plugin-ecommerce/types'
```

## Template

The [Templates Directory](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates) also contains an official [E-commerce Template](https://github.com/payloadcms/payload/tree/main/templates/ecommerce), which uses this plugin.
